    title: "What is React?",
    content:
      "React is a powerful and flexible JavaScript library developed by Facebook that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces for web applications by utilizing a component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering."
  },
  {
    title: "Why use React?",
    content:
      "React is widely used because it simplifies the process of building complex and scalable web applications, offers excellent performance through its virtual DOM, and provides a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries to enhance development productivity."
  },
  {
    title: "How does React work?",
    content:
      "React operates by maintaining a virtual representation of the DOM in memory, which allows it to efficiently calculate the minimal set of changes required to update the real DOM, resulting in faster and smoother user interface updates."
  },
  {
    title: "What are React components?",
    content:
      "React components are modular and reusable building blocks of a user interface that encapsulate their own logic and rendering, enabling developers to create complex applications by composing smaller, manageable pieces."
  },
  {
    title: "What is JSX?",
    content:
      "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making it easier to define the structure and appearance of React components in a readable and expressive manner."
  },
  {
    title: "What are React hooks?",
    content:
      "React hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that allow developers to use state and other React features in functional components, providing a more concise and flexible way to manage component behavior."
  },
  {
    title: "What is the virtual DOM?",
    content:
      "The virtual DOM is a lightweight and efficient representation of the real DOM that React uses to optimize rendering by calculating the minimal set of changes needed to update the user interface."
  },
  {
    title: "What is React Router?",
    content:
      "React Router is a popular library for managing navigation and routing in React applications, enabling developers to define routes and handle transitions between different views or pages seamlessly."
  },
  {
    title: "What is Redux?",
    content:
      "Redux is a state management library that provides a predictable and centralized way to manage application state, making it easier to debug and maintain complex React applications."
  },
  {
    title: "What is the difference between props and state?",
    content:
      "Props are immutable data passed from parent to child components to configure or customize their behavior, while state is mutable data managed within a component to track changes and control its rendering."
  },
  {
    title: "What is the useEffect hook?",
    content:
      "The useEffect hook is a versatile function in React that allows developers to perform side effects such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations in functional components, with the ability to control when these effects are executed."
  },
  {
    title: "What is the useState hook?",
    content:
      "The useState hook is a fundamental React function that enables developers to add state management to functional components, providing a way to store and update data that influences the component's rendering."
